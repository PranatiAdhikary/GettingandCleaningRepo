# Introduction
---------------------------------
You have to download sourse data from link below and unzip it to working directory of R Studio.
You have to perform R script.
### About source data :

As sourse data for work was used Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

### R Script :
-----------------------------------------------------

File with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):

Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.

1. Reading files
2. Reading trainings tables
3. Reading testing tables
4. Reading feature vector
5. Reading activity labels
6. Assigning column names
7. Merging all data in one set
8. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
9. Reading column names
10. Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
11. Making nessesary subset from finaldataset
12. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
13. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
14. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
15. Making second tidy data set
16. Writing second tidy data set in txt file


## Variables:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
- features contains the vectors present in the downloaded file
- activityLabels contains the differrent activities present in the downloaded file
- mrg_trainingData, mrg_testingData merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
- finaldataset merges both the previous merged training and testing data set to create a new data set.
- mean_and_std vector has created for defining ID,mean and standard deviation
- setForMeanAndStd variable has created to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from the finaldataset
- Finally, secTidySet contains the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
